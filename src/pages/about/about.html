                            Each had their independent dreams of
                            creating a brewery for the community of
                            Surf City, Sneads Ferry, Hampstead and
                            Holly Ridge. Daniel and Dean met in 2016,
                            they lived in the same neighborhood and
                            realized they both shared the same passion of owning a brewery. Zack White partnered with Daniel and
                            Dean, May of 2017, his knowledge of prior and existing small businesses will ensure the success of the
                            brewery. Salty Turtle Beer Company is all about being a “neighborhood brewery”. We have partnered with
                            Karen Beasley’s Sea Turtle Hospital and other local organizations that will give back to this community
                            of ours.</h1>

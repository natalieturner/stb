                    Both Daniel and Dean have been homebrewing since 2013. Each had their independent dreams of creating a brewery for the community of Surf City, Sneads Ferry, Hampstead and Holly Ridge. Daniel and Dean met in 2016, they lived in the same neighborhood and realized they both shared the same passion of owning a brewery. Zack White partnered with Daniel and Dean, May of 2017, his knowledge of prior and existing small businesses will ensure the success of the brewery. Salty Turtle Beer Company is all about being a “neighborhood brewery”. We have partnered with Karen Beasley’s Sea Turtle Hospital and other local organizations that will give back to this community of ours.
